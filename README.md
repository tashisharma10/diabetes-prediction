# diabetes-prediction
This repository contains a machine learning model using SVM classifier for predicting diabetes based on health metrics.
Libraries Used:
seaborn: Used for data visualization.
Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
StandardScaler: Used from sklearn.preprocessing to scale features.
SVM (Support Vector Machine): Used from sklearn.svm for training the classification model.
Train Test Split: Used from sklearn.model_selection to split data into training and testing sets.
Accuracy Score: Used from sklearn.metrics to evaluate model performance.
Matplotlib.pyplot: Used for data visualization and plotting.
